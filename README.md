## The Journey :
 It was a challenging task for me because the website have very vast feature and functionalities as this is my third project and also i had to clone the website within a week, it was like i was the Product Manager and the developers as well. I faced many problems to solve the bugs, comparison to previous project we add many functionality like set time interval, dropdown in navbar in a extensive way , adding more feature so that is very tough challenges for me . I initiate this project with proper planning, visions also we never forget any priorities and with the coordination of each schedule in a discipline manner i completed this project. I tried my best to clone the website from scratch based on the knowledge gained from unit 3 at Masai School
